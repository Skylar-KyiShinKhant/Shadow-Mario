## About The Project
Upon launching the project, the initial window features a menu bar at the top, housing several buttons. However, access to certain buttons is restricted until you log in.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Before Log In</td>
    <td>Log In Button</td>
    <td>Logging In</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-1.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-2.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-3.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Upon successful login, the previously labeled __Log In__ button is now identified as __Log Out__, and access is granted to all other buttons.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Buttons become active</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-5.png"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Upon selecting the __Registration__ button, a window will display member list, along with detailed information. In this interface, you have the ability to manipulate the members' data by creating, updating, deleting, or searching.


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Adding New Member</td>
    <td>Updating Member's credit</td>
    <td>After Update</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-6.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-7.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-8.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Searching
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-9.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-10.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-11.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Similarly, when you click on __Game Set__ button, __Game__ button, or __FoodAndDrink__, a window will be presented, showcasing a list of data available. Within this interface, you can also perform various operations such as creating, updating, deleting, or searching.

Game Sets window
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-12.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-13.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Games window
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-14.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-15.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Food and Drink window
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-16.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-17.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The functionality of the __User Setting__ button operates in a similar fashion. However, when creating or updating new users, the window prompts for passwords and allows you to specify the buttons to which the new user will have access.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-18.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-19.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Within the __Play__ button, editing rows is restricted. Nevertheless, when creating a new record for a purchase from a specific supplier, you have the option to view the details of the purchase by clicking on the plus sign located on very left column.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Accessing Play Button</td>
    <td>Creating New Play Voucher</td>
    <td>Checking Details of A Play Record</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-20.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-21.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/ECafe-POS/blob/master/ecafe-ss/Screenshot-22.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

After all the tasks, you have the option to either __Log Out__ or __Exit__ the program based on your decision.
