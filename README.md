In Level Two, there will be floating platforms that move left and right. So are enemies. Special powers exist: cherries will double the collided coin value (from 1 to 2), and stars will make Mario invincible to enemies for a certain period upon contact.

In Level Three, in addition to the features from Level Two, there is an enemy boss who attacks with fireballs. Mario must defeat the enemy boss with fireballs to win the game.
